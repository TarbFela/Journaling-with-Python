This is a personal project which I intend to place into Google Drive on my computers. It is designed to be a painfully simple notebook where I can record ideas and thoughts at almost a moment's notice. This is also a good opportunity for me to practice my Python programming, with simple inheritence and some object properties with getter and setter methods.

The UI for this currently runs through the command-line.
